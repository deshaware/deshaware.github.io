									My Journey</h1> -->
									<h2>It's My Story</h2>
									<p>I completed my bachelors in Computer Engineering at one of the prestigious institute, Dr.
										D Y Patil's Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai. I completed with first class with distinction</p>

								<p>
									After completing my undergrad studies, I have been offered a full-time software engineer role at LTI. I have had an opportunity to work with India's leading Construction, Finance, and Oil & Gas personnel to design, develop new tools, and migrate the existing system. My key contribution was to develop a learning portal and design, develop and deploy a bank guarantee portal for Corporate Finance and Treasury Team. Later I had been associated with Chevron, Australia, to enhance and migrate existing SharePoint sites, improve various internal tools, and design workflows to automate business decisions. I was awarded a trophy at the annual symposium for developing a project from the scratch and delivering in stipulated timeline.
								</p>
								<p> 
									After a successful venture at LTI, I joined forces with NIUM, one of the exciting and young FinTech startups. NIUM recently received a Tech Unicorn status with the Series D funding and saw its valuation rise above $1 billion. Working with the team of hundreds at LTI to anÂ extremely smaller and efficient team at NIUM gave me a broader perspective of technology. I actually solved real-world problems. With experience over my shoulder, I was assigned an auto-reconciliation tool project. As a backend developer, I designed several microservices and scalable APIs for General Ledger Services. I have modularized and developed NPM packages for parsing SWIFT statements. I had coordinated with the VISA team to auto-reconcile the card transactions, for which I designed a completely automated, PCI-DSS compliant solution on AWS. I have also integrated payment gateways, Elasticsearch and Kibana and automate deployment with Jenkins and AWS Fargate.									
								</p>
								<p>
									Learning has always been an important part of my life and every day I want to bring something new to the table. I wouldn't mind spending an extra hour to learn and develop myself. I would spend after-office hours learning cutting-edge technologies. Distributed and Decentralized Systems caught my mind. I completed a specialization course to learn Ethereum, Solidity at the University at Buffalo. To expand my horizons, I came up with a decision to study further and I started sending my applications to many grad schools. Due to my decent academic credentials and GRE, TOEFL score, I was accepted at many grad schools. Syracuse University happened to be on the top of the list because of its diverse program and intensive research in the blockchain.
